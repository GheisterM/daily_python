# Daily Python

Wishing to further formalize my Python coding experience, I started the course "100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp" by Dr. Angela Yu. Since Day 7, no matter how begginer was the code, I decided to do it on a daily basis to play a little with my Python Skills and the challenges proposed by the instructor.

So feel free to review the code, and use it as you like. Be sure to visit the course at:
